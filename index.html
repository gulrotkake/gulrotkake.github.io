    <h2>Simple OSX Screenshot Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Being an overly paranoid developer I have an immediate distrust
      to small opaque convenience services that upload my data to
      servers I do not control. One such service that I use almost
      daily is a screenshot service. A quick Google search to see if
      any of those screenshot services could upload to a personal
      server came back empty-handed. Thinking that it can't be that
      hard, I decided to roll my own. Luckily, for once, it wasn't
      that hard, here's how I did it:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, to make things a little cleaner and less prone to
      mistakes, I configured OSX to place all screenshots into a
      specific directory called ~/Screenshots:
    <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>
    <pre><code class="bash">
        # Change the screenshot directory to ~/Screenshots
        $ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots/

        # Restart the SystemUIServer, to start using new directory
        $ launchctl stop com.apple.SystemUIServer.agent
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, using the Apple Script Editor (included with OSX), I wrote
    a small Apple Script, called upload-image, which copies <em>png</em>
    files from the screenshot directory, to a remote server, using scp:
    <pre><code class="applescript">property username : "ubuntu"
property hostname : "tightloop"
property target_path : "/data/static"
property target_url : "http://image.tightloop.io/"

on adding folder items to folder_name after receiving list_files
  tell application "Finder"
    set random to ""
    repeat 5 times
      set random to random & some item of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"
    end repeat
    set screenshot to item 1 of list_files

    if name extension of screenshot is in {"png"} then
      set the screenshot_path to the quoted form of the POSIX path of screenshot
      do shell script ("scp " & screenshot_path & " " & username & "@" & hostname & ":" & target_path & "/" & random & ".png")
    end if
    set the clipboard to target_url & random & ".png"
    display notification "Uploaded image, link copied to clipboard" with title "Uploaded"
  end tell
end adding folder items to</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I placed the newly created upload-image script in
      the <em>/Library/Scripts/Folder\ Action\ Scripts/</em>
      directory, right-clicked on the Screenshots folder and selected
      "Folder Actions Setup..."
      <img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/folder_action.png" alt="Folder Actions Setup..."/>
      and from the list of Folder Actions, I selected the upload script
      <img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/upload_action.png" alt="Add upload"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally on my server, which is
      running <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a>, I simply set up a
      static location to serve <em>png</em> files:
      <pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name image.example.com;

    location ~ \.(png)  {
        root /data/static;
    }
}</code></pre>
    </p>
